# Solace

A fullstack application built with React, Node.js, Python, Flask, and PostgreSQL. Solace offers full CRUD capabilities on multiple models that allows you to log, track, and manage your sleep, personal journal as well as meditation. The app utilizes JSON Web Token for authorization/authentication, and PostgreSQL models/tables for data structures. The app is deployed to Heroku and can be accessed and used [here]().

### The Team
Both of us did extensive work in the front end (React/Node.js) and back end (Python/Flask/PostgreSQL) for this application, leveraging Git team workflow & Agile methodologies to manage our different tasks each day during this one-week sprint.

### About Solace
Placeholder text
 
#### **Mission statement:**
Solace aims to promote mindfulness & mental health. Starting off initially as an idea for a sleep tracker app, we realized the potential for this application as a vehicle to encourage self-care in a larger capacity.
 
The app intends to provide users with a platform to tune in with how they are feeling on a daily basis.
