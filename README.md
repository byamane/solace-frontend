### The Team
Both of us did extensive work in the front end (React/Node.js) & back end (Python/Flask/PostgreSQL) for Solace, leveraging Git team workflow & Agile methodologies to manage our different tasks each day during this four-day sprint.

### Mission Statement
 
Solace aims to promote mindfulness & mental health. Starting off initially as an idea for a sleep tracker app, we realized the potential for this application as a vehicle to encourage self-care in a larger scope.
 
The app intends to provide users with a platform to tune in with how they are feeling on a daily basis. Users can log, track, & manage their sleep, personal journal as well as meditate --- **all on the go**!
